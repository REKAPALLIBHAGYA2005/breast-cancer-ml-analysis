# Performance Analysis of ML Techniques for Identifying Breast Cancer

This notebook presents a comparative analysis of multiple machine learning
algorithms for classifying breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant using
the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.

The objective is to evaluate model performance using standard metrics and
identify the most reliable classifier for early detection support.
