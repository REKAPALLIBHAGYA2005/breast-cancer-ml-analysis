# Performance Analysis of ML Techniques for Identifying Breast Cancer

This project compares multiple machine learning algorithms to classify
breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant using the Wisconsin Breast
Cancer Dataset.

## Dataset
- Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset
- 570 samples (210 malignant, 360 benign)
- 31 tumor-related features

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection
- Model training and evaluation

## Models
- Remember Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree

## Results
Random Forest achieved the best overall performance with Precision,
Recall, and F1-score close to 0.99.
